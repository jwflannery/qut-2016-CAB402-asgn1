Challenge part attempted, but produces the wrong output in test 10. That's expected; I just didn't have time to fix it.
Executables in the exe folder are just copies of the relative release builds, in case it's easier to have them all in one place.
Debug builds produce the same output, of course, as would building them from the sln yourself.

That's it, then. Thanks for your hard work.
